# AI-Generated vs Human-Written Code: A Comprehensive Comparison

## Overview

This project is a prototype and blog post assessment for Coder Academy, designed to critically compare AI-generated code with human-written code in the context of a RESTful student grading system backend. The goal is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach across key software development criteria, providing insights into the current capabilities and limitations of AI-assisted coding tools.

## Project Structure

The repository contains two parallel implementations of the same backend system:

- **/ai-generated/**: Codebase generated entirely by an AI tool (Cursor)
- **/human-written/**: Codebase written manually by a student developer

Each implementation provides CRUD operations for the following core entities:
- Students
- Teachers
- Courses
- Enrollments
- Grades

## What This Project Aims to Achieve

- **Critical Comparison**: Offer a side-by-side analysis of AI-generated and human-written codebases, focusing on code quality, maintainability, security, documentation, and developer experience.
- **Educational Value**: Serve as a resource for students and developers to understand the practical differences between AI-assisted and manual coding practices.
- **Prototype Assessment**: Demonstrate the strengths and limitations of current AI coding tools in a real-world backend application scenario.
- **Blog Post Foundation**: Provide a comprehensive, well-documented basis for a technical blog post or report.

## Key Features

- **Detailed Code Comparison**: In-depth analysis of both codebases against professional software development criteria.
- **RESTful API Implementations**: Both projects implement a RESTful API for managing students, teachers, courses, enrollments, and grades.
- **Documentation and Readability**: Highlights the importance of clear documentation, code comments, and user-friendly setup instructions.
- **Security and Validation**: Examines the presence (or absence) of security best practices and data validation in each codebase.
- **Developer Experience**: Assesses tooling, scripts, and overall ease of use for each project.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore the Codebases**: Review the `/ai-generated/` and `/human-written/` folders to compare implementation styles, structure, and documentation.
2. **Read the Comparison**: See `AI_vs_Human_Code_Comparison.md` for a detailed, rubric-based analysis of both projects.
3. **Prototype/Assessment**: Use this repository as a reference for understanding the current state of AI-generated code versus human-written code in backend development.

## For Coder Academy

This repository was created as part of a blog post/prototype assessment for Coder Academy. It aims to provide a transparent, educational, and critical look at the evolving role of AI in software development, highlighting both its potential and its current limitations.
